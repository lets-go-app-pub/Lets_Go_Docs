TESTING BASICS 
-NOTE: test on min API (API 21) too
-NOTE: Make sure leak canary and valgrind are on.
-NOTE: Test rotating each Fragment.
-MatchScreenFragment (and UserInfoCard)
--swipe yes on match (actually drag the card, clicking the button is done by automated tests)
--swipe no on match (actually drag the card, clicking the button is done by automated tests)
--swipe yes on event
--try each block & report option
--click on picture and make sure can swipe back and forth
--try drop down menus
---look for an overlapping time
---look for a close time
---look for a time that is neither overlapping or between
---look for anytime
--try left and right arrows to change picture observed
--remove a user's picture from the cache and make sure it can update
--swipe a match away when offline (it should send them again when login retries; unsentSimpleServerCommandsDataSource.insertMessage)
--when run of swipes make sure timer properly displays and counts down (move away and back to see errors)
--Because the layout view_user_info_card_time_frame.xml only contains a single bar, make sure that multiple timeframes that overlap a single timeframe or multiple 'close' timeframes do not crash (there is a NOTE in optimizations_after to add this feature later). For example user is 5:00->6:00 and 7:00->8:00 and match is 4:00->9:00. And vice versa, if the match has 2 'inside' of the user. Also with between times something like user 4:00->5:00 and 8:00->9:00 and match is 6:00->7:00.

-test offline in various parts of the app specifically the chat room (clicking on a chat room to navigate to chatRoomFragment and navigating inside, sending messages etc.)

ADVANCED TESTING
-leave one server up at a time and make sure device can still connect (only Android, the desktop interface connects to one specificially)
-take down all servers and make sure device gracefully handles it
-press home when initial login screen and blank loading screen are displayed, make sure it still works
-install app while screen is still off (all black), make sure it doesn't break and properly continues
-make sure if User A logs into an account User B is currently logged into it gracefully kicks User A off, and then kick User B off using user A
-test joining a matching chat room with a 3rd user before users have msged each other (should not allow the user to join)
-test try canceling a match then joining the chat room with a 3rd user (should function like a chat room)
-uninstall and reinstall and make sure delete 'sticks' (meaning the account is actually deleted on the server and cannot log back in to it)
-make sure cannot have popup menu for a message that has not been sent to server
-make sure when changing primary picture, thumbnail is updated for other users.
-when opening the camera in ChatRoom make sure that
--receiving a message works all right (ChatStreamObject stays subscribed)
-corrupt a picture inside the database, check and make sure things don't crash and other users can't see it (need to make it an invalid image AND keep size consistent, consistent size is expected)
-PICTURES TESTING (and how thumbnails update when deleting a picture from desktop interface)
-test if chat room thumbnail is retained during update
--1) user A creates chat room 1,
--2) user A sends a message in chat room 1 (so other user can see thumbnail)
--3) user A leaves chat room 1 (chat room is empty now)
--4) user A changes their thumbnail
--5) user A creates chat room 2
--6) user A sends a message in chat room 2 (so other user can see thumbnail)
--7) user A leaves chat room 2 (chat room is empty now)
--8) user B joins chat room 2
--9) user B joins chat room 1
--the chat room 2 thumbnail is the most recent and so it should be retained
--Make sure the dialog requesting POST_NOTIFICATION permission works properly on API 33 and API 32 (it should ask for the permission on API 33 and send to the setting screen if notifications are off on API 32)
-When using the release version, minimize the app using the home button, then use the icon to open it, it should NOT restart the app or go through the LoginActivity.

DESKTOP INTERFACE
-update user info (name birthday etc...) and make sure it works
