# Lets_Go_Docs ‚Äî assets, ops notes, and web glue for the Lets Go platform

This repo centralizes **product docs, images/assets, deployment/playbooks, and web integrations** used across the project. It‚Äôs a reference archive for recruiters and developers exploring how the system was operated and shipped.

> **Contents:** product documentation ¬∑ images/icons ¬∑ fonts ¬∑ admin notes ¬∑ SSL/TLS test material ¬∑ server deployment snippets ¬∑ WordPress helpers (Django prototype kept for history)

---

## Highlights (skim me)

- **Images & icons:** complete activity/category icon set, app logos, store-listing art, and Android UI glyphs.
- **Operations:** server setup snippets (iptables, limits), MongoDB replica set notes, and release checklists.
- **Web tier glue:** WordPress **mu-plugins** for user flows (account recovery, email verification), plus an **obsolete Django** prototype.
- **Developer aids:** emulator setup, SSL test certs (non-production), and Qt Desktop Interface helper scripts.
